1. The comments to the constructor suggest it creates a ball object with the specified weight and capacity. There is parameter defined for weight. Either weight needs to be a final static field / property, it needs to be added, or the comment needs to not reference it. I decided to add it as a field, like capacity.
2. The getCapacity() method needs to return this.capacity and not 0.
3. Added a getWeight() method to return this.weight. 
4. Added a BALL_WEIGHT member to the BallTest class.
5. Included BALL_Weight to the construction of new Ball in BallTest.
6. Added a testWeight() method to BallTest.
7. BallContainer needs generic type.
8. I think the approach to using an iterator is better than constantly updating a field because it requires less management of updating the field. Also, it is duplicating data and requires additional memory on the heap, which is unnecessary. 
9. to implement getBallsFromSmallest() I decided to make Ball implement Comparable, which required me to implement compareTo(). 
10.
