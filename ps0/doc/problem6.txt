1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test? 
	Because the initial if () statement used an invalid condition, I corrected the condition.
2. The second if () statement was invalid so I corrected it.
3. The last return statement was subtracting when it should be adding the recursive results.
